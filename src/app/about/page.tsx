      <p className="mb-4">
        Hey! I'm Kabir, a software developer with a background in computer science and business. I love building intuitive,
        well-structured applications that solve real-world problems and offer a great user experience.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        My journey started with government infrastructure, and Iâ€™ve since expanded into cloud platforms, full-stack
        development, and AI-powered projects. I'm always curious and constantly learning new tools and technologies.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new cultures, gaming, or playing guitar (badly but enthusiastically).
