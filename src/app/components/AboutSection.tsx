        Hi, I am Kabir - With a degree in Computer Science and Business, I enjoy building software solutions that connect technology with real-world needs.<br /><br />
        I have hands-on experience with Python, Java, JavaScript, and DevOps tools like Docker and Git, and have worked on projects using React, Node.js, and cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure.<br /><br />
